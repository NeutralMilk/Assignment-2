# Assignment-2
2nd assignment

In my game the aim is to mine all the golden asteroids. To collect them simply fly over them.
There is a chance of picking up a bomb by collecting a gold asteroid.

White asteroids reset the level and put you back to the spawn point.

Red asteroids are explosive and send you back to the previous level, so watch out.
The red ones can be blown up remotely using the bombs you find.
Blowing these up destroys surrounding white comets, and also collects the gold ones surrounding it.

To blow them up click on them with your mouse.
